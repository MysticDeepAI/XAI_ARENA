# XIA ARENA: Implementation and Comparison of Interpretability Methods

This repository is dedicated to the implementation and rigorous comparison of both agnostic and introspective interpretability methods. The goal is to evaluate these methods using well-defined metrics and frameworks, providing a clear view of their strengths and weaknesses.

## Project Objectives

1. **Implementation of Interpretability Methods**: This repository will include the implementation of various interpretability methods for black-box models. Both agnostic methods (which do not require internal knowledge of the model) and introspective methods (which do require such knowledge) will be addressed.

2. **Rigorous Comparison**: The interpretability methods will be evaluated under homogeneous and fair conditions. Various metrics and frameworks will be used to ensure a thorough and objective comparison.

3. **Evaluation of Black-Box Models**: Eight black-box models with specific characteristics challenging the capabilities of interpretability methods will be implemented and evaluated.

## Repository Content

- **Implementation of Interpretability Methods**: Code and detailed documentation of agnostic and introspective methods.
- **Black-Box Models**: Implementations of eight black-box models used for evaluation.
- **Evaluation Frameworks**: Scripts and tools for the comparative evaluation of interpretability methods.
- **Documentation**: Detailed guides on how to use the repository, install dependencies, and run experiments.
